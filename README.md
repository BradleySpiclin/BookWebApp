# BookWebApp
Vue.js Web Application
---

This web application was my first introduction to using JavaScript and the Vue.js framework.
I have implemented some Vue features including Vue router, local and global components, templates, v-model directive and computed properties.

This application includes an inspirational quotes section on the home page which can be refreshed to select a new quote from an array of strings 
stored from an API call. The main functionality of this app is allow the user to enter title and author of books they wish to read, adding them
to their personal library. Status of books can be changed dynamically from reading/read/unread and any changes inclusing removing titles can be saved.
When the library is saved a computed property sorts the books in order of reading status. Also included are counters for each total of book statuses.

The contact page includes a basic form for user feedback.

The navigation bar includes some JavaScript for current datetime and Vue router makes navigation between pages seamless.
